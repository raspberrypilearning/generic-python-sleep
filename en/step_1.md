You can use the `sleep` function to temporarily pause your Python program.

+ Add this line of code at the top of your program to import the `sleep` function.

```python
from time import sleep
```

+ Whenever you want a pause in your program, call the `sleep` function. The number in the brackets indicates how many seconds you would like the pause to be.

```python
sleep(2)
```

You can pause for fractions of a second as well.

```python
sleep(0.5)
```
