You can use the `sleep` function to temporarily pause your program.

+ Add this line of code at the top of your program to import the sleep function

```python
from time import sleep
```

+ Whenever you want a pause in your program, call the sleep function. The number in the brackets is how many seconds you would like the program to pause for.

```python
sleep(2)
```

You can pause for fractions of a second too

```python
sleep(0.5)
```
